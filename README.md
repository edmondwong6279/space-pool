# Space pool rendered with Threejs

Getting some practise using threejs for rendering and cannon-es as the physics engine.

## Running the application:
Developed using node 16.17.1.

```yarn install```

```yarn build```

```yarn start```

## To do:
1. Background image is very large, either optimise or create loading screen that pauses until all assets are loaded in.
2. Physics of force applied is not always accurate
